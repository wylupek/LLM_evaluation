Because it had too many problems.\\nHaha, that\\'s a good one!\\n```\\n\\nThis function takes a joke as a string and prints it out, followed by a response to the joke. You can replace the joke and the response to create your own joke-telling program! 😄\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Exercise 2: Ask for User Input**\\n\\nWrite a function that asks the user for their name and age, and then prints out a personalized greeting.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    None\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    None\\n    \"\"\"\\n    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\\n    age = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!

You are 25 years old.\\n```\\n\\nThis function uses the `input` function to ask the user for their name and age, and then uses an f-string to create a personalized greeting. You can customize the greeting to fit your needs! 😊\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Exercise 3: Calculate the Area of a Rectangle**\\n\\nWrite a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    length (float): The length of the rectangle.\\n    width (float): The width of the rectangle.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    float: The area of the rectangle.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    def calculate_area(length, width):\\n        return length * width\\n\\n    length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\\n    width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\\n    area = calculate_area(length, width)\\n    print(f\"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.\")\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n```\\nEnter the length of the rectangle: 5\\nEnter the width of the rectangle: 3\\nThe area of the rectangle is 15.0 square units.\\n```\\n\\nThis function takes the length and width of a rectangle as input, calculates the area using the formula `length * width`, and then prints out the result. You can customize the input prompts and output message to fit your needs! 📐\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Exercise 4: Create a Simple Calculator**\\n\\nWrite a function that creates a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    None\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    None\\n    \"\"\"\\n    def calculator():\\n        print(\"Simple Calculator\")\\n        print(\"1.

Please try again.\")\\n            return\\n\\n        print(f\"The result is {result}.\")\\n        print(\"Thank you for using the calculator!\")\\n\\n    calculator()\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n```\\nSimple Calculator\\n1. Addition\\n2. Subtraction\\n3. Multiplication\\n4. Division\\nChoose an operation (1-4): 2\\nEnter the first number: 5\\nEnter the second number: 3\\nThe result is 2.0.\\nThank you for using the calculator!\\n```\\n\\nThis function creates a simple calculator that asks the user to choose an operation and enter two numbers. It then performs the chosen operation and prints out the result. You can customize the calculator to add more operations or features! 🤖\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Exercise 5: Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**\\n\\nWrite a function that creates a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user can play against the computer.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    None\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    None\\n    \"\"\"\\n    import random\\n\\n    def rock_paper_scissors():\\n        choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\\n        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\\n\\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): \")\\n        user_choice = user_choice.lower()\\n\\n        if user_choice not in choices:\\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\\n            return\\n\\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\\n            print(f\"Both players chose {user_choice}. It\\'s a tie!\")\\n        elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\\\\n             (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\") or \\\\\\n             (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\"):\\n            print(f\"{user_choice.capitalize()} beats {computer_choice}. You win!\")\\n        else:\\n            print(f\"{computer_choice.capitalize()} beats {user_choice}. You lose!\")\\n\\n    rock_paper_scissors()\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n```\\nEnter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): rock\\nBoth players chose rock. It\\'s a tie!\\n```\\n\\nThis function creates a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user can play against the computer. The computer chooses a random choice, and the user enters their choice. The function then determines the winner based on the game\\'s rules and prints out the result. You can customize the game to add more features or complexity! 🎲\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we explored the basics of Python programming and created five exercises that demonstrate various concepts and techniques. We learned how to write functions, ask for user input, calculate the area of a rectangle, create a simple calculator, and create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.\\n\\nThese exercises are just a starting point, and you can build upon them to create more complex and interesting programs. Remember to practice regularly, and don\\'t be afraid to ask for help when you need it.

I mean, think about it: the chicken is making a choice to cross the road, to take a risk and venture into the unknown. And that's what we're all doing, right? We're all making choices to cross our own roads, to take risks and venture into the unknown. And that's what makes life so exciting, right? The possibility of discovery, of growth, of change.\n",

The chatbot then responds with a message encouraging the user to share their joke and even offers to help create a new joke together. The code uses a dictionary to store the chatbot's responses and a loop to repeatedly ask the user for input. The user's input is stored in a variable and then used to generate the chatbot's response. The chatbot's responses are printed to the console and the program continues to run until the user decides to quit.\n"
